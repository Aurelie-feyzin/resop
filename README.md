# Projet ResOp - Réserve Opérationnelle

# Présentation du projet

*ResOp* est un outil de gestion, planification et projection de moyens humains et opérationnels dans un cadre de crise.

Ce projet a été lancé par la Cellule Ressources & Anticipation de la Croix-Rouge Française à Paris dans le cadre du dispositif COVID-75.
Son but est de recenser les disponibilités des bénévoles afin de connaître le plus précisément possible les ressources sollicitables
et d'avoir de la visibilité sur les engagements à réaliser.

## Roadmap

La première version du projet a été développée en 48 heures par une équipe de bénévoles pour les besoins précis du dispositif COVID-75.

Dans une seconde version, il serait intéressant d'adapter ResOp aux autres opérations et structures de la Croix-Rouge Française,
puis aux autres associations de réponse à l'urgence.

# Project presentation

*ResOp* is a management, planning and projection tool for human and operational resources in a crisis context.

This project was launched by the Resources & Anticipation Unit of the French Red Cross in Paris as part of the COVID-75 system.
Its purpose is to identify the availability of volunteers in order to know as precisely as possible the resources that can be called upon,
and to have visibility on the commitments to be made.

## Roadmap

The first version of the project was developed in 48 hours by a team of volunteers for the specific needs of the COVID-75 operation.

In a second version, it could be interesting to adapt ResOp to other operations and structures of the French Red Cross,
then to other emergency response associations.

# Install

## Requirements

* git
* make
* docker >= 18.06
* docker-compose >= 1.23

### Linux

```bash
git clone git@github.com:crf-devs/resop.git && cd resop
make
```

### OS X

```bash
git clone git@github.com:crf-devs/resop.git && cd resop

make pre-configure
make configure

# Caution: you need to uncomment all `:cached` lines in the `the docker-compose.override.yml` file

make all
```

### Windows

* Install [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install)
* Enable [Docker support  for WSL2](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl-tech-preview/)
* Checkout project directly within WSL, using a native windows directory as a project root will cause massive performances issues and issues with watchers ( i.e : yarn encore ).
* Run Linux build steps from WSL

Note : PHPStorm do not currently provide a good native integration, with WSL2, you will mainly need to open the directory from WSL directory, usually the name is \\wsl$\ located at same level at c/. See : [IDEABKL-7908](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-7908) and [IDEA-171510](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-171510)

### Without Docker

*Disclaimer: This method is not recommended, please prefer the Docker way if you can.*

If you don't want to use the provided Docker stack (such a weird idea, but why not), you can easily run the stack as in old times, with you own php & node & prostgres services

**Requirements**

- PHP 7.4
- Node >= 13, Yarn >= 1.22
- PostgreSQL 11
- [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download)

**Install**

Create a `.env.local` file and set the database url:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>/<DB>?serverVersion=11&charset=utf8
```

From the `Makefile`, copy & run the following tasks commands manualy (you must remove the `bin/tools` or `bin/node-tools` prefix):

- vendors
- webpack-build-dev
- init-db

Then, you can serve the project:

```bash
symfony server:start
```

If you want to watch JS & CSS changes, run:

```bash
yarn encore dev --watch
```

That's it :) If you need any other command, you can look for it in the `Makefile`.

### With Vagrant + VirtualBox

If you want to run the stack with Vagrant, you can have a look to [this PR](https://github.com/crf-devs/resop/pull/186) in order to find a working config.

## Run

After the `make` command, go to [http://resop.vcap.me:7500/](http://resop.vcap.me:7500/),
or [https://resop.vcap.me:7583/](https://resop.vcap.me:7583/) for https (self signed certificate).

If you want to run a symfony or a php command: `bin/tools <command>`, example: `bin/tools bin/console`

### Run : after a first install

You don't need to build all the stack every time. If there is no new vendor, you can simply run:

```bash
make start
```

## Access

The project is using a Traefik proxy in order to allow access to all the HTTP services of the project. This service is listening on the 7500 port of the host.
The `*.vcap.me` domain names are binded on localhost. In order to use them offline, you only have to add a
`127.0.0.1 adminer.vcap.me resop.vcap.me traefik.vcap.me` line on your `/etc/hosts` file.

### Stack

- [http://resop.vcap.me:7500](http://resop.vcap.me:7500)
- [http://adminer.vcap.me:7500](http://adminer.vcap.me:7500)
- [http://traefik.vcap.me:7500](http://traefik.vcap.me:7500)

Caution: the traefik proxy will only serve healthy containers. The api container can be unaccessible before the first healthcheck (5s).

### Database

A PostgreSQL server is provided by the docker-compose file, as well as an `adminer` web interface.

```yaml
  postgres:
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=resop
      - POSTGRES_USER=resop
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgrespwd
```

**Web interface**

If you want to access the data, the easiest way is to use the [adminer](http://adminer.vcap.me:7500) service from your browser.

**Host port binding**

If you need to access the DB from your host, you must uncomment the following lines in your `docker-compose.override.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  # ...
  postgres:
    # ...
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
```

Then, run `docker-compose up -d postgres`. The DB is now available on the `localhost:5432` port!

### HTTPS

The nginx container is available over HTTPS. This url must be used in order to use Facebook, Gmaps, camera...

- [https://resop.vcap.me:7543](https://resop.vcap.me:7543) ou [https://resop.vcap.me:7583](https://resop.vcap.me:7583)

## Before commiting

Please always run the following commands before commiting, or the CI won't be happy ;-)

```bash
make fix-cs
make test
```

Hint: you can run `make fix-cs-php` instead of `make fix-cs` if you are one of those backend devs who don't touch any css or js file.

### Tests

```bash
make test # Run all tests except coverage
make test-cs # php-cs-fixer
make test-advanced # phpstan
make test-unit # phpunit
make test-unit-coverage # phpunit + phpdbg
```

## PHP

### Tools & commands

As the php-fpm docker container doesn't contain any dev tool as composer, all dev commands must be run on the `tools` container. For example:

```bash
bin/tools composer
bin/tools bin/console cache:clear
bin/tools # to open a shell on the tools container
```

### Blackfire

In order to profile the php app with [Blackfire](https://blackfire.io/), you need to have a Blackfire account, then:

- Uncomment the `blackfire` part of the `docker/php-flex/Dockerfile` file (but don't commit it after)
- Uncomment the `blackfire` service in the `docker-compose.override.yml` file
- Uncomment the blackfire env var for the `fpm` service in the `docker-compose.override.yml` file
- Add your [credentials](https://blackfire.io/my/settings/credentials) in the `docker-compose.override.yml` file
- `docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate fpm blackfire`
- That's it, you can [profile](https://blackfire.io/docs/cookbooks/profiling-http) the app!

## Node

A node container is available in order to run `yarn` commands for `webpack encore`:

```bash
bin/node-tools yarn encore dev

webpack-build-dev
make webpack-watch-dev
```

## Built docker images

Every time a new commit is pushed onto master, the following Docker images are built:

- [crfdevs/resop:fpm-master](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/crfdevs/resop/tags?page=1&name=fpm)
- [crfdevs/resop:nginx-master](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/crfdevs/resop/tags?page=1&name=nginx)

Every time a new release is created, the following Docker images are built:

- [crfdevs/resop:fpm-1.1.1](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/crfdevs/resop/tags?page=1&name=fpm-)
- [crfdevs/resop:fpm-release-latest](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/crfdevs/resop/tags?page=1&name=fpm-release-latest)
- [crfdevs/resop:nginx-1.1.1](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/crfdevs/resop/tags?page=1&name=nginx-)
- [crfdevs/resop:nginx-release-latest](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/crfdevs/resop/tags?page=1&name=nginx-release-latest)

## Usage in production

This is an example of docker-compose.yml file with parameters you should use for production:

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
    image: crfdevs/resop:nginx-release-latest
    depends_on:
      - fpm
    environment:
      - "FPM_ENDPOINT=fpm:9001"

  fpm:
    image: crfdevs/resop:npm-release-latest
    environment:
      - INIT_DB=true # Run migrations on start
      - DANGEROUSLY_LOAD_FIXTURES=false # Reset DB and load fixtures on start
      - "DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<URL>/<DB>?serverVersion=11&charset=utf8"
```

If you want to initialize the DB with production data, run the following command in the fpm container:

```bash
bin/console app:load-organizations
```
